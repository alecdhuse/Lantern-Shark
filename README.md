# Lantern Shark
Lantern Shark is a file analyzer written in HTML and JavaScript. It can extract metadata and embedded script code from multiple file types. It also attempts to identify suspicious and malicious attributes of various file types.

A live demo of this project can be viewed [here](https://alecdhuse.github.io/Lantern-Shark/).

# Additional Features
  - Deobfuscation of extracted scripts via inserted comments. Look for the comment caracter followed by the ðŸ¦ˆ shark emoji.

# Notes
This project is under heavy development, and currently only supports a small number of file types.
See the table below for a list of supported file types and types of data extracted from each.
